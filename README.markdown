## Matter.js with ClojureScript

Playing around with the Figwheel live reload functionality and
Matter.js produces some good fun! See [this
video](http://url.brentvatne.ca/17JzR) for an example.

To enjoy it for yourself, install [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) with `brew install leiningen`, clone this repo and run `lein figwheel` from the cloned directory. Then open your brower to [http://localhost:3449/](http://localhost:3449/) and open up `src/matter_cljs_fun/core.cljs` in your favorite text editor and go to town.
